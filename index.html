                    HTML5 is the latest standard for browsers to display and interact with web pages.
                    Approved in 2014, it's the first update to HTML in 14 years. In this day and age,
                    that's a lifetime between updates.

                    A web page consists of markup—HTML (HyperText Markup Language) that describes the meaning
                    of the content on the page—and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that tell the browser how the
                    content should be displayed in browsers and other user agents that need to display it.
                    CSS tells the browser everything from the layout of the page to the colors of your headings.

                    JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on
                    web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static
                    information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, or interactive maps,
                    or animated 2D/3D graphics, or scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.
                    — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.
